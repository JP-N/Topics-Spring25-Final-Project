For Problem 1, echo.py, I created a list to collect parts for the echoed text, and used a for loop to iterate petition times, set to 3 times. The output returns the last three characters, then the last two characters, and then the last character of a word, for example, Hellooo would return ooo, oo, o.

For Problem 2, fib.py, I created a timer which establishes the start, end, execution time, and result. I also created a fibonacci function. In the main function, I create x and y lists, x for each fibonacci number calculated (fib(1) to fib(100)) and y for how many seconds it took for each fibonacci number to be calculated, x and y respectively appended to add to the graph.
